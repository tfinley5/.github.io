                    Hi Im Trenton Finley. Im 21 years old and started working out at 16 years old in high school. I never got really into it until I took a Strength Programming Class at NC State. I enjoyed it a lot so it became a hobby to apply that class to myself. This hobby has changed how I live my life. Not only is it fun to do but it has made me live a healthier lifetsyle. All around it has made me more fit and confident. 
                </p>

            <h2>Workout Scheduling</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                People tend to use the excuse that they don't have the time to go to the gym all the time. Most people who go to the gym as a hobby either keep a strict gym schedule or use their free time to go to the gym. The good thing about working out is that you don't even need to go to the gym to do it. All you need is the will to get up and do it at anytime of the day.
                </p>
            
                <h3>My Weekly Workout Schedule</h3>

                </table>

                <p>Another big thing that comes with working out a making progress is a meal plan. Having to figure out how much to eat and what is in the food can be a lot. Most advanced gym goers use meal prepping as a way to maintain an eating schedule.</p>

            <h2>My Gyms</h2>
            <div>

                <p> When going back and forth between college in Charlotte and my home back in Fayetteville, I always like to have something to work out with. Thankfully, I invested in a home gym when I lived at home for a year. That way I am not having to spend any money on a gym membership whether I'm at college or at home. Speaking of no gym membership costs, UNCC provides free use of a new gym for it's students so I want to get as much use of it while I am still here.</p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Going to the gym takes a lot of energy. Some people don't need anything but determination to workout. Most people who go reguarly, including myself, have built a reliance on pre-workout supplements to have energy for the gym. Other supplements that can boost your progress include powdered protein, creatine, amino acids, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is also many different ways to workout. Many people do cardio which requires no equipment. There is weighlifting, which requires additional weights to do exercies depending on strength. Calisthenics is using body weight which normal just requires a pull-up bar. Different workouts require different equipment.

            <h2>Why I Go To The Gym</h2>
            <div>
                
                <p>I started working out because I was self-concious about my weight all the way through high school. I was an athletic kid but I was just so skinny. After about 2 years of off and on working out and finishing high school I still was at a beginner level. In college there was so much stress that came with going to a school that none of your friends went to. I naturally found myself back in the gym but for different reasons than when I started. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Going to the gym is beneficial to be in many ways. First off its really good for you to do some type of physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day. So its easy when you enjoy it. The main reason I do it is because it's essentially a free therapy session. Letting any type of stress or anger out in the gym is easily the best feeling ever. No one will bother you can you can just do you. SO the reason I do it is because it makes me an all around happier person.</p>
